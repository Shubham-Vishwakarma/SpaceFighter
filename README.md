# SpaceFighter

Space Jet has to kill the enemies by hitting them. There will also be some good guys and our Space Jet should not kill them. So basically if Space Jet  touches other character that will be destroyed. So we have to only kill the enemies.

# The Game Rules

1. Player ship has to kill the enemies by colliding with them.

2. If player lets 3 enemies to go safely then the game is over.

3. If player kills a good guy the game is over.
